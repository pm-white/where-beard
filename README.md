# James Beard Semifinalists Map

A map of semifinalists for the James Beard Foundation Restaurant and Chef Awards. Includes data from 2025, with plans to add semifinalists each year going forward.

The awards data was scraped from the James Beard Foundation website using the [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) Python library. The restaurant locations were retrieved from the Google Maps [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview).

The frontend site is a [React](https://react.dev/) app, and the backend is [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
